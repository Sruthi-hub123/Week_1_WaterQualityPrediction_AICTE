# Week_1_WaterQualityPrediction_AICTE
This project was created during the AICTE Virtual Internship (June 2025), sponsored by Shell. It uses machine learning to predict water quality parameters like NH₄, BOD5, NO₃, and more using a RandomForestRegressor with MultiOutputRegressor in Python.
# Overview
Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.
In this project, we:
* Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets
* Used supervised machine learning for multi-target regression
* Built a pipeline using MultiOutputRegressor with RandomForestRegressor
* Evaluated the model using appropriate regression metrics
# Technologies Used
#Python 3.12

#Pandas, NumPy – Data handling

#Scikit-learn – Machine learning model and evaluation

#Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

#Jupyter Notebook – Interactive experimentation
